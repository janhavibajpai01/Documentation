I recently finished a one-month internship at Lets Grow More Community. My name is Janhavi. I learned a lot as a Web Developer Intern intern that will be extremely beneficial to me in the future of my profession. I want to share my experience and give you a behind-the-scenes glimpse at what it’s like to intern at Lets Grow More Community Corporation in this blog post.

I was assigned a number of jobs over the first several weeks of my internship, including carrying out market research, writing social media posts, and helping with event preparation. The amount of responsibility I was handed astounded me. The company’s dedication to sustainability and social responsibility also struck a chord with me. Midway into my internship, I was given a bigger project to work on. I was tasked with coming up with a marketing strategy for the launch of a new product. I had to apply every skill I had acquired up to this point, including market research, branding, and copywriting, for this project. I faced difficulties, but my mentor helped me achieve them by offering advice and encouragement.

Overall, I had a fantastic internship experience with Lets Grow Community. I received a tonne of knowledge, useful skills, and relationships that will last a lifetime. Anyone searching for an internship would do well to look at this company, in my opinion. Please feel free to comment below if you have any queries or would like to learn more about my experience.
